# CPF / CNPJ Sample Microservice Application

This is a companion of a simple CPF/CNPJ (that's what we Brazilians use for official registration of people and companies) based in microservices. The backend (Golang + MongoDB) offers a RESTful interface with CRUD methods for managing inclusion of CPF/CNPJ numbers, and the frontend (React Flux) is a SPA application that provides a simplistic view of the backend.
